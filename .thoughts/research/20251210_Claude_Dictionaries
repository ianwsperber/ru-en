# Russian Lexical Resources for Kindle Dictionary Development

Building a comprehensive Russian-English Kindle dictionary that handles both 19th-century literary Russian and modern vocabulary requires combining multiple specialized sources. **The optimal approach uses Wiktionary (Kaikki.org) as the primary Ru-En source, Dal’s dictionary for historical coverage, OpenCorpora for morphological generation, and OPUS parallel corpora for modern usage—a combination that surpasses any single resource.**

The Big Academic Dictionary (БАС), which would be the most comprehensive single source, has **no publicly available digital version**—a critical finding that shapes the recommended multi-source strategy.

## Monolingual Russian dictionaries provide the historical foundation

### Vladimir Dal’s Dictionary (Толковый словарь Даля, 1863-1866)

Dal’s dictionary is indispensable for 19th-century Russian, containing approximately **200,000 entries** covering peasant dialects, folk vocabulary, regional expressions, and archaic terms that appear throughout Tolstoy’s works.

|Thai Dict Project|StarDict/XDXF |Via rutracker.org (V-I-C edition, 2021) |
|mova.org archives|dictd format |Part of standard StarDict collections |

**License:** Public Domain (original work from 1880s)

**War & Peace suitability:** Excellent—essential for understanding archaic terms, Church Slavonic elements, peasant speech patterns, and 19th-century vocabulary. Dal was Tolstoy’s contemporary, and this dictionary captures the linguistic texture of that era.

**Modern suitability:** Limited—no post-1866 vocabulary, but invaluable as a historical layer.

### Ushakov’s Dictionary (Толковый словарь Ушакова, 1935-1940)

This dictionary bridges pre-revolutionary and early Soviet Russian, containing **87,454 headwords** with usage examples and stylistic labels.

|Thai Dict Project|StarDict |`https://docs.google.com/uc?id=1WFbt3PsmwyOn6ccy-H6mmZt6fTreX9gq&export=download`|

**License:** Public Domain (Soviet publication, 70+ years old)

**War & Peace suitability:** Good—includes literary vocabulary and pre-revolutionary terms with explanations.

**Modern suitability:** Moderate—covers vocabulary through the 1930s but lacks contemporary terms.

### The Big Academic Dictionary does not exist in open digital form

**БАС (Большой академический словарь)** would theoretically be the most valuable source with **150,000+ entries** across 30 volumes representing the most comprehensive Russian dictionary ever compiled. However, extensive research confirms:

- Published by the Institute of Linguistic Studies (ИЛИ РАН) as an ongoing print project since 2004
- An internal database exists from a 2008 card catalog digitization, but it remains inaccessible
- No DSL, StarDict, XML, or any machine-readable format is publicly available
- Commercial print editions only through publisher “Наука”

**This is the single largest gap in open Russian lexicography.**

### Ozhegov and alternative dictionaries

Ozhegov’s dictionary exists in StarDict format but with reduced coverage (~38,837 entries versus the claimed 80,000). A better alternative is **МАС (Малый академический словарь)** with 80,000+ words, available from Thai Dict Project:

`https://docs.google.com/uc?id=1T4O70CkVlMWJS_gL5jJwYSzlnxUlJbId&export=download`

## Bilingual sources form the translation layer

### Wiktionary via Kaikki.org delivers the highest-value extraction

Kaikki.org processes raw Wiktionary dumps into structured JSONL with all templates expanded, making it dramatically superior to raw XML dumps for dictionary extraction.

**Russian-specific download:** `https://kaikki.org/dictionary/Russian/kaikki.org-dictionary-Russian.jsonl`

|Metric |Value |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
|Entry count |**424,943** distinct Russian word forms |
|Senses breakdown|235,317 noun senses, 217,329 verb senses, 22,220 adjective senses|
|Format |JSONL (one JSON object per line) |
|Size |771.6 MB |
|License |CC BY-SA |
|Last updated |December 6, 2025 |

**Included data:** Definitions in English, etymologies, IPA pronunciation, inflection tables (declensions/conjugations), grammatical labels, usage examples, topic categories.

**Kaikki vs raw Wikimedia dumps:** Raw XML at `dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiktionary/` requires template expansion, Lua macro processing, and language filtering—months of development work that Kaikki.org eliminates. The pre-parsed JSONL is ready for dictionary conversion.

**War & Peace suitability:** Good—Wiktionary has reasonable coverage of literary and archaic terms with etymological notes.

**Modern suitability:** Excellent—continuously updated with contemporary vocabulary, technical terms, and slang.

### Mueller7 remains the only open-source edition

The V.K. Müller dictionary (7th edition, 1961) is available at `https://mueller-dict.sourceforge.net/` with **46,231 entries**.

|Format |Availability |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
|DICT (dictd server)|Primary format |
|StarDict |stardict-mueller7accentgpl-2.4.2.tar.bz2 |
|Raw text |Multiple encodings (UTF-8, KOI8-R, Windows-1251)|

**License:** GNU GPL v2.0+

**No newer open-source versions exist.** Commercial publications from AST/Эксмо claim 120,000-500,000 entries but are proprietary. The 1996 GPL release by S. Starostin remains definitive for open-source use.

**War & Peace suitability:** Moderate—mid-20th century vocabulary captures some literary terms.

**Modern suitability:** Poor—no vocabulary after 1961; missing all contemporary technical, internet, and slang terms.

### OpenRussian offers modern morphological data

The community-driven OpenRussian database at `https://github.com/Badestrand/russian-dictionary` provides:

- CSV files (nouns.csv, verbs.csv, adjectives.csv) with full paradigms
- Stress marks on all words
- ~32,000 frequency-ranked words
- Example sentences from Tatoeba
- License: CC BY-SA 4.0

**Limitation:** Does not prioritize archaic vocabulary.

-----

## Morphological resources enable inflection lookup

A Kindle dictionary must handle Russian’s complex morphology—users may look up any inflected form (genitive plural, past perfective, etc.) and expect to find the lemma. Three key resources address this:

### OpenCorpora provides the primary morphological database

**Direct downloads:**

- XML (compressed): `http://opencorpora.org/files/export/dict/dict.opcorpora.xml.bz2`
- ZIP version: `http://opencorpora.org/files/export/dict/dict.opcorpora.xml.zip`

|Metric |Value |
|----------|------------|
|Lemmas |389,232 |
|Word forms|5,097,247 |
|Format |UTF-8 XML |
|License |CC BY-SA 3.0|

Each lemma includes all grammatical forms with feature tags (case, number, gender, tense, aspect, etc.). This is the foundation for pymorphy2/pymorphy3 morphological analyzers.

**Coverage:** Modern standard Russian; limited archaic/dialectal forms.

### Zaliznyak’s dictionary is now officially digitized

The authoritative grammatical reference (~110,000 words with complete paradigms) has an official machine-readable version:

**Repository:** `https://github.com/gramdict/zalizniak-2010`

|Feature |Detail |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Edition |6th (2010), official data from rights holder |
|Format |Plain text files organized by last letter (А.txt–Я.txt) |
|License |CC BY-NC (non-commercial); commercial licensing via human@gramdict.ru|
|Coverage|Full paradigms, stress marking, difficulty annotations |

**Alternative sources:**

- odict.ru: Zaliznyak + ~8,000 additions (CC BY-SA 3.0)
- StarlingDB: Online searchable interface at starlingdb.org

### pymorphy3 compiles OpenCorpora for runtime use

The pymorphy2/pymorphy3 Python libraries use OpenCorpora as their data source, compiling it to DAWG (Directed Acyclic Word Graph) format for efficient lookup:

**Installation:** `pip install pymorphy3-dicts-ru`

The compiled dictionaries work across implementations (Python pymorphy3, Java jmorphy, JavaScript Az.js, Rust rsmorphy).

-----

## Parallel corpora supplement modern vocabulary gaps

Traditional dictionaries lag behind contemporary usage. OPUS parallel corpora fill this gap:

### OpenSubtitles captures colloquial and slang vocabulary

The largest OPUS collection at **20 billion sentence pairs** from movie and TV subtitles provides authentic modern Russian including youth slang, profanity, and colloquial constructions absent from traditional dictionaries.

**Access:** `https://opus.nlpl.eu/OpenSubtitles/corpus/version/OpenSubtitles` (v2024, Feb 2025)

**Processing approach:** Word alignment tools (eflomal, GIZA++) can extract high-confidence translation pairs that supplement dictionary entries.

### Tatoeba provides curated example sentences

At **8.7 million sentence pairs** with CC-BY 2.0 license, Tatoeba offers human-verified translations ideal for dictionary usage examples:

- Direct download: `https://tatoeba.org/en/downloads`
- HuggingFace: Helsinki-NLP/tatoeba_mt

### Technical vocabulary from software localization

**KDE4** (201M sentence pairs) and **GNOME** (225M sentence pairs) corpora at opus.nlpl.eu contain software UI terminology, IT vocabulary, and modern technical terms rarely found in traditional dictionaries.

## Additional resources expand coverage

### natasha/corus aggregates 350GB+ of Russian text

The `https://github.com/natasha/corus` project links 20+ corpora with Python loaders:

|Corpus |Size |Value |
|---------------|------------------|---------------------|
|Lib.rus.ec |145GB (302K texts)|Literary Russian |
|Mokoron Twitter|17.6M tweets |Social media language|
|Taiga Social |648MB |Social network posts |
|Taiga Subtitles|909MB |Colloquial dialogue |

### HuggingFace offers ready-to-use datasets

Notable resources:

- `Den4ikAI/russian_dialogues_2`: 1.7M conversational contexts (272 MB)
- `RussianNLP/russian_super_glue`: Word sense disambiguation data
- `Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-ru-en`: Pre-trained translation pairs

### Russian National Corpus limitations

The full RNC at ruscorpora.ru is **not downloadable**, but derived resources exist:

- Python API: `https://github.com/kunansy/RNC` (rate-limited)
- Leeds frequency lists: `http://corpus.leeds.ac.uk/ruscorpora.html` (116M words)
- UD SynTagRus: 900K tokens with syntactic annotation at `github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Russian-SynTagRus`

## The optimal combination strategy

**Is Wiktionary + Dal the best combination?** It’s a strong foundation, but incomplete. The recommended architecture:

### Layer 1: Primary translation source

**Kaikki.org Wiktionary** (424,943 entries) provides the broadest English definitions and serves as the main lookup database.

### Layer 2: Historical vocabulary enrichment

**Dal’s Dictionary** (200,000 entries) supplies 19th-century terms, dialects, and archaic vocabulary for *War and Peace* compatibility. Entries without Wiktionary coverage get definitions translated/adapted from Dal.

### Layer 3: Morphological generation

**OpenCorpora** generates all inflected forms that redirect to lemma entries, ensuring любил → любить, городов → город lookups succeed.

### Layer 4: Modern vocabulary supplementation

**OpenSubtitles + Tatoeba** sentence pairs, processed through word alignment, add contemporary slang and usage examples missing from traditional dictionaries.

### Layer 5: Quality refinement

**OpenRussian** adds stress marks and verified translations for its coverage range; **Zaliznyak** provides authoritative paradigm validation.

### What this combination provides:

- **19th-century coverage:** Dal + Wiktionary etymologies + Ushakov bridge vocabulary
- **Modern coverage:** Wiktionary + OpenSubtitles slang + KDE4/GNOME technical terms
- **Complete morphology:** OpenCorpora’s 5M+ word forms ensure any inflected lookup works
- **Translation quality:** Multiple source cross-validation

### What remains unavailable:

БАС (Big Academic Dictionary) would add ~50,000 additional refined literary entries unavailable through any open source. This gap cannot currently be filled with public data.

-----

## Technical implementation path

**Conversion workflow for Kindle:**

1. Parse Kaikki.org JSONL into dictionary entries with definitions
1. Merge Dal DSL entries (convert via pyglossary) for historical terms
1. Generate inflection redirects from OpenCorpora XML
1. Export to MOBI using kindlegen or the Vuizur/Wiktionary-Dictionaries methodology at `github.com/Vuizur/Wiktionary-Dictionaries`

**Key tools:**

- pyglossary: Format conversion between DSL, StarDict, and other formats
- pymorphy3: Runtime morphological analysis for form generation
- lsdreader: Decompile commercial LSD to DSL if needed

This multi-source approach—rather than any single dictionary—achieves the most complete coverage across the 150+ year span from Tolstoy to contemporary Russian.
